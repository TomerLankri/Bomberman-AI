# Bomberman-AI
A  project in which i developed artificial intelligence agents including reinforcment learning and  to the infamous game bomberman 
using the online competition "pommerman" as a framwork to work on. 

I have used several techniques to create different agents such as reinforcment learning, informed search, q-learning and more. 
In each technique i used the parameters to create agent with different characters such as : offensive, defensice, balanced and more.
